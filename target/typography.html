			<p class="text">The <a class="uppercase" href="#">mit gov/lab</a> is a research group of political scientists focusing on innovation in citizen engagement and government responsiveness. We collaborate with social enterprises, funders, and governments on research that builds and tests theories about how innovative programs and technologies can make governments more accountable to citizens. In each of our projects, we aim to provide operationally useful information to practitioners as well as to contribute to theoretical knowledge.</p>
			<p class="text">Through our approach of iterated research and development, we help our organizational partners learn in real time and make mid-course corrections to their programs. Each collaborative project begins with an initial stage of open-ended exploratory field research to generate hypotheses and identify specific mechanisms connecting an intervention or technology to the outcomes our partners seek. Using rigorous social science methods, we then conduct a series of focused investigations and experiments to help practitioners learn which operational and design choices are most effective in particular contexts. We do not believe in “one-size-fits-all” interventions; instead, we focus on research and development of context-specific interventions.</p>

			<h6 class="project-collaborators italic">With <a href="http://mindmixer.org">MindMixer</a></h6>
			<p class="text project-text">A growing group of technology companies is working with cities to create alternative opportunities for citizens to participate in government online. Our experiment revealed that online feedback is often longer and more detailed than feedback collected through Town Hall Meetings, addresses different issues, and is percieved as more novel by city government officials.</p>

			<p class="text project-text">The Guatemalan NGO CEGSS has developed an innovative SMS system that allows community leaders to send concerns about local health	 service provision directly to government officials, in addition to making them public online. MIT GOV/LAB is using a randomized experiment, varying who receives information sent through the online system, to decipher how this type of ICT intervention can best improve government responsiveness.</p>

			<p class="text project-text">MIT GOV/LAB and the local Liberian NGO Parley have teamed up to create a web portal, based in Monrovia, which will gather data directly from citizens about their needs and requests for assistance from government authorities, and these requests will be sent to various government agencies and NGOs. In addition to facilitating requests for assistance, the website will make publicly available heat maps and interactive graphics, which allow users to visualize the dispersion of the crisis.</p>
